# Final Project (80%, due Fri May 7 at 23:59:59)
To demonstrate your understanding of the material we have covered, you will perform a data analysis project in R.
**You may choose to do a project on your own or with one other teammate.** (If working with a teammate, only one person has to submit the work. The names and SUNet IDs of both teams should be clearly labeled.)
While you may discuss ideas and troubleshoot code with each other, each person or team must submit a unique project.

Here are the project minimum requirements:

* One `.Rmd` file, as well as one `.html` file. (Don't worry about what these file formats are and how to create them right now; we'll talk about this in Week 3.)
* Use a dataset that we have not used in class. If using an external dataset, provide the data file and/or a link to it.
* An "Introduction" section describing the problem and the datasets to be used.
* A "Data analysis" section where you have code. Code should have accompanying text that describes what the code is doing and interprets the results.
* At least 3 data visualizations per person on a team - these must be of at least two different types for people working alone and of at least three different types for teams.
* A "Conclusion" section to summarize the results of the analysis, as well as any deviations from the project proposal.

## Rubric

The final project is graded out of 5 points - 2 or more is a guaranteed pass. The rubric is:

5 - An excellent analysis that offers serious insight into the data and comes to non-trivial conclusions.

4 - A robust analysis with varied, interesting and appropriate graphics.

3 - A basic analysis that showcases some aspects of the data, but is missing variety and/or leaves more interesting avenues unexplored.

2 - An acceptable analysis that meets the minimum requirements of the project.

1 - A submission with major components missing

0 - No submission


# Project Proposal (20%, due Fri April 23 at 23:59:59)
For the project proposal, submit a 1-2 paragraph description of your final project.
You should provide details on the problem you wish to explore, any datasets that you will use, and potential visualizations.
The proposal is a way for me to make sure that you have enough structure and data to complete the project.

The project proposal should be submitted as a text file (any format will do).

In implementing your final project, you should try to stick as closely to your proposal as possible.
If you are unable to do so, please provide a paragraph in your final project to explain the deviations from the proposal.

## Rubric

The project proposal is graded out of 2 points. The rubric is:

2 - A convincing proposal indicating that the student is on track to complete the final project.

1 - A proposal that shows a lack of preparation required to complete the final project without additional intervention.

0 - No submission

# Submission instructions
Both the project proposal and final project should be submitted through email to me at [damianp@stanford.edu](mailto:damianp@stanford.edu).

The subject line of your submissions should have the following format:
* stats32 proposal submission (your SUNet ID), (your partner's SUNet ID if applicable)
* stats32 project submission (your SUNet ID), (your partner's SUNet ID if applicable)


# Finding project partners
If you wish to work in a team and are looking for a partner, please post in the Discussions tab of the Canvas page.
Either reply to the existing discussion post or create your own.

# What might the final project look like?
Here are some examples of good student projects from previous runs of this class:

* [Socioeconomic Disparity in the U.S](/assets/past-projects/caroline-huang-denise-lopez-soza.html), by Caroline Huang and Denise Lopez Sosa
* [Movie Data](/assets/past-projects/ben-schwartz.html), by Ben Schwartz
* [Development Assistance to Asia and the Asia-Pacific](/assets/past-projects/baroncatherine_LATE_135896_5133065_Baron-STATS-32-Project.html), by Catherine Baron
* [US Education](/assets/past-projects/birknernicole_148476_5122624_STATS-32-Final-Project-Birkner-Jazo.html), by Nicole Birkner and Juan Jazo
* [World Happiness](/assets/past-projects/jonesmaikasato_185180_5088240_Jones_Maika_STATS32_Final.html), by Maika Jones
* [Fast Food in America](/assets/past-projects/wilsonhaileypaige_111009_5119854_Stats 32 Final Project_ Fast Food in America.htm), by Hailey Wilson


Here are some examples found online which would fit what I'm looking for in a final project:

* [Network analysis of Game of Thrones family ties](https://www.r-bloggers.com/network-analysis-of-game-of-thrones-family-ties/) (but shorter)
* [Sentiment Analysis of The Lord of the Rings with tidytext](https://www.r-bloggers.com/sentiment-analysis-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-with-tidytext/) (but longer)
* [Text analysis of Trump's tweets confirms he writes only the (angrier) Android half](https://www.r-bloggers.com/text-analysis-of-trumps-tweets-confirms-he-writes-only-the-angrier-android-half/)
* [Reproducible Finance with R: Sector Correlations](https://www.r-bloggers.com/reproducible-finance-with-r-sector-correlations/)
* [The heat is on... or is it? Trend Analysis of Toronto Climate Data](https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-heat-is-on-or-is-it-trend-analysis-of-toronto-climate-data/)
