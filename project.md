I had previously stated that projects and proposals should be submitted through Gradescope.
Since it is impossible to submit .html files through Gradescope, **all project submissions should be emailed directly to me as detailed in the "Submission instructions" section of this page.**

# Final Project (80%, due Sat May 16 at 23:59:59)
To demonstrate your understanding of the material we have covered, you will perform a data analysis project in R.
**You may choose to do a project on your own or with one other teammate.** (If working with a teammate, only one person has to submit the work. The names and SUNet IDs of both teams should be clearly labeled.)
While you may discuss ideas and troubleshoot code with each other, each person or team must submit a unique project.

Here are the project minimum requirements:

* One `.Rmd` file, as well as one `.html` file. (Don't worry about what these file formats are and how to create them right now; we'll talk about this in Week 3.)
* Use a dataset that we have not used in class. If using an external dataset, provide the data file and/or a link to it.
* An "Introduction" section describing the problem and the datasets to be used.
* A "Data analysis" section where you have code. Code should have accompanying text that describes what the code is doing and interprets the results.
* At least 3 data visualizations (not all of the same type).
* A "Conclusion" section to summarize the results of the analysis, as well as any deviations from the project proposal.

# Project Proposal (20%, due Fri May 1 at 23:59:59)
For the project proposal, submit a 1-2 paragraph description of your final project.
You should provide details on the problem you wish to explore, any datasets that you will use, and potential visualizations.
The proposal is a way for me to make sure that you have enough structure and data to complete the project.

The project proposal should be submitted as a text file (any format will do).

In implementing your final project, you should try to stick as closely to your proposal as possible.
If you are unable to do so, please provide a paragraph in your final project to explain the deviations from the proposal.

# Submission instructions
Both the project proposal and final project should be submitted through email to me at [damianp@stanford.edu](mailto:damianp@stanford.edu).

Please include your SUNet ID (or IDs for team submissions) as well as the phrase "stats32 project submission" in the subject line of your project submission (or "stats32 proposal submission" for your proposal submission).

# Grading and Deadlines
The project proposal is due by May 1 (Fri), 23:59:59 and is worth 20%.

The final project is due by May 16 (Sat), 23:59:59 and is worth 80%.

For each late day, a multiplicative penalty factor of 0.8 will be applied.
Work that is submitted more than 2 days after the due date will receive **0 points**.
If you foresee that you may have difficulty meeting these deadlines, please come and speak with me **immediately**.

# Finding project partners
If you wish to work in a team and are looking for a partner, please post in the Discussions tab of the Canvas page.
Either reply to the existing discussion post or create your own.

# What might the final project look like?
Here are some examples of good student projects from previous runs of this class:

* [Development Assistance to Asia and the Asia-Pacific](/assets/past-projects/baroncatherine_LATE_135896_5133065_Baron-STATS-32-Project.html), by Catherine Baron
* [US Education](/assets/past-projects/birknernicole_148476_5122624_STATS-32-Final-Project-Birkner-Jazo.html), by Nicole Birkner and Juan Jazo
* [World Happiness](/assets/past-projects/jonesmaikasato_185180_5088240_Jones_Maika_STATS32_Final.html), by Maika Jones
* [Fast Food in America](/assets/past-projects/wilsonhaileypaige_111009_5119854_Stats 32 Final Project_ Fast Food in America.htm), by Hailey Wilson


Here are some examples found online which would fit what I'm looking for in a final project:

* [Network analysis of Game of Thrones family ties](https://www.r-bloggers.com/network-analysis-of-game-of-thrones-family-ties/) (but shorter)
* [Sentiment Analysis of The Lord of the Rings with tidytext](https://www.r-bloggers.com/sentiment-analysis-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-with-tidytext/) (but longer)
* [Text analysis of Trump's tweets confirms he writes only the (angrier) Android half](https://www.r-bloggers.com/text-analysis-of-trumps-tweets-confirms-he-writes-only-the-angrier-android-half/)
* [Reproducible Finance with R: Sector Correlations](https://www.r-bloggers.com/reproducible-finance-with-r-sector-correlations/)
* [The heat is on... or is it? Trend Analysis of Toronto Climate Data](https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-heat-is-on-or-is-it-trend-analysis-of-toronto-climate-data/)
* [Mid Table Mediocrity](https://www.r-bloggers.com/mid-table-mediocrity/)
