A list of interesting R resources to be updated throughout the course.
If you find something cool and/or helpful, email it to and I might add it to this page!

**R educational resources**

* [Webpage of the previous version of this course:](https://web.stanford.edu/~kjytay/courses/stats32-aut2019/) Taught by Kenneth Tay - much of this course is based on that, but it's worth a look to see a slightly different presentation of similar subjects and get some datasets to play with
* [R-Exercises:](https://www.r-exercises.com/start-here-to-learn-r/) A large collection of R exercises arranged by topic
* [R-bloggers:](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) Lots of vignettes and examples of data analysis done in R
* [kaggle:](https://www.kaggle.com/) A site that hosts data science competitions. Though we won't be covering any statistical or machine learning techniques in this course, its a great source of clean datasets.

**Datasets**
* Governmental or NGO open data websites (e.g. [City of Palo Alto](http://data.cityofpaloalto.org/home), [State of California](https://data.ca.gov/), [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/))
* [Awesome Public Datasets:](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) A compilation of links to various open datasets
* [Google Dataset Search:](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) A tool for searching for open datasets
* [Data Is Plural:](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) A weekly newsletter of interesting datasets.
* [New York Times US Covid-19 data:](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) Live updating dataset containing state-by-state and county-by-county infection data.
	
**Fun R stuff**
* [R shiny dashboard](https://sjfmarks.shinyapps.io/nba_shiny_dash/) for correlations between various stats for NBA 2017-18 season
* [Making XKCD-like graphs](http://xkcd.r-forge.r-project.org/)
* [Animated plots](https://towardsdatascience.com/animating-your-data-visualizations-like-a-boss-using-r-f94ae20843e3) using various R packages
* [Visualizations projected on the earth as a globe](https://www.displayr.com/interactive-globe-r/)
* [Visualizing soccer world cup goals](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2018-06-29-visualize-worldcup/)
