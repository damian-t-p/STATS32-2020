# Course format

This course is usually with interactive sessions where I would assist you in person as you work through labs.
Unfortunately, the move to distance instruction makes this format impossible, and I intend to shift to a more lecture-based approach.

If you have comments or suggestions about the format _please email them to me!_
I will try to anticipate your educational needs as much as I can, but if you explain what you need to me, I will be able to do this much more effectively.
I cannot promise to implement all suggestions, but I can promise to take them all seriously.
