# Interactive lectures

The slides-and-lectures approach to teaching is not ideal for hands-on subjects such as programming, and left something to be desired when this course was offered last year.
Fortunately, we now have all of last year's lectures recorded and available as resources for this iteration.

I intend on having (something like) the following format for lectures:
* Prior to each class, you should view the corresponding video from last year's course.
* Each 80 minute class will then consist of
  * Me giving a 20min summary of that week's most important points,
  * A 50min "lab" session, where you work in small breakout rooms through a prepared task as I move between groups and provide guidance,
  * A 10min conclusion with the whole class, where I address some common issues and make some final remarks.

The plan is very schematic, and is liable to change as we gauge how well it goes!
If you have comments or suggestions about the format _please email them to me!_
I will try to anticipate your educational needs as much as I can, but if you explain what you need to me, I will be able to do this much more effectively.
I cannot promise to implement all suggestions, but I can promise to take them all seriously.
