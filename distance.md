# Revised class schedule

The class will still be held in weeks 1-6 of quarter.
Due to the delay of first quarter by one week, this means:
* **Lectures:** Weeks 2-5, April 13 to May 7
* **Office hours** Weeks 1-6, April 8 to May 13

All deadlines are also pushed back by a week, and the accurate dates are those listed on this website.

Lectures and office hours will be held through Zoom, and the link will be provided closer to the start of quarter.

# Course format

This course is usually with interactive sessions where I would assist you in person as you work through labs.
Unfortunately, the move to distance instruction makes this format impossible, and I intend to shift to a more lecture-based approach.

If you have comments or suggestions about the format _please email them to me!_
I will try to anticipate your educational needs as much as I can, but if you explain what you need to me, I will be able to do this much more effectively.
I cannot promise to implement all suggestions, but I can promise to take them all seriously.
