# Recap of session 2: Data tables

A standard-form data table is a matrix of values where

* each row is the record of a single observation and
* each column represents a single variable being measured.

In this lecture we will see how to use a data table to gain insight about the variables (corresponding to columns) and how they relate with each other.

This is essentially a definition of data presentation.

# Data presentation

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
efficiency <- mtcars %>%
    as_tibble %>%
    transmute(
        mpg = mpg,
        cylinders = factor(cyl, ordered = is.ordered(c(4, 6, 8))),
        weight = wt * 1000,
        horsepower = hp,
        engine = factor(vs, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("V-shaped", "straight")),
        transmission = factor(am, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("automatic", "manual")),
        gears = factor(gear)
    )
```


We start with a big and unwieldy table of numbers.
How do we extract useful information about it?

## Numerical summaries

Try this out on some vectors and dataframes

* Column metadata: `str`, `summary`
* Typical entries: `head`, `tail`
* Table structure: `names`, `dim`, `nrow`, `ncol`
* Summary statistics: `mean`, `median`, `sd`, `var`

```{r}
summary(efficiency)
head(efficiency)
sd(efficiency$weight)
```

# Plots and visualizations

Each (variable) column specifies a graphical element of a plot

* x-y coordinates of a point in a scatterplot
* Height of a bar in a bar graph
* Part of a bin count in a histogram

## The layered grammar of graphics

Ingredients of a plot:

* Data table (must be in long format, that is, a row for each observation)
* Specification of which column should be represented with which graphical element (coordinate, color, line style...). Provided to `ggplot` with the `aes` (aesthetic) function
* Type of plot (scatterplot, line chart, histogram...). Named with `geom_` prefix
* Coordinate system (cartesian flipped cartesian, world map...). Named with `coord_` prefix
* Additional customization options

```{r}
ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = weight, y = mpg, color = transmission)) +
    geom_point(size = 3) +
    ggtitle("Fuel efficiency vs vehicle weight")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = cylinders, fill = transmission)) +
    geom_bar() +
    coord_flip()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = horsepower)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +
    geom_freqpoly(aes(color = engine), bins = 10)
```

# Two classes of variables in statistics

* **Continuous variable**: Variable takes on values which fall on the real number line (or part of it)
    + E.g. height, exam score, attendance count
    + Encoded in number and date types
* **Categorical variable**: Variable takes on values which fall into discrete categories
    + E.g. ice-cream flavor, country of origin
    + Encoded in string and factor types
    + *Warning*: You may sometimes want to use integers as categorical variables. In order to tell R this, you must convert them to strings or factors first.
	
```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

Notice that number of cylinders is a number, not a factor, so it is treated as a continuous variable.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = cyl)) +
    geom_point(size = 3)
```

But the only cylinder numbers are 4, 6 and 8, so we probably want to treat them as discrete, after all, the above graphic has a color designation for 3.56 cylinders, which isn't at all useful!

```{r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
    geom_point(size = 3)
```

By converting the number of cylinders to the factor type, R now knows to treat it as a discrete variable and the resulting plot makes much more sense!

# The factor type

R has an additional type `factor` that it uses to record a discrete variable with finitely many possible values, called "levels"

```{r}
mtcars$cyl
factor(mtcars$cyl)
```

We can add additional levels that are not represented in the data vector to allow possible values
```{r}
factor(mtcars$cyl, levels = c(4, 6, 8, 12))
```

The levels of the factors are the important parts, so we can supply arbitrary labels:
```{r}
weekdays <- factor(
    c(1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 2, 1),
    levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7),
    labels = c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"),
    ordered = TRUE)

weekdays
```

We've also supplied the `ordered` argument to `factor()`.
This lets R know about the order of the days of the week so that they can (for example) be plotted in the right order automatically

We can also easily relabel factors:
```{r}
levels(weekdays) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")

weekdays
```

# Barplots: counts for a categorical variable

*What is the distribution of cylinders in my dataset?*

```{r}
ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = cylinders)) +
    geom_bar() +
    ggtitle("Count by cylinders") +
    xlab("No. of cylinders")
```

# Histograms: counts for a continuous variable

*What is the distribution of `miles per gallon` in my dataset?*

```{r}
ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = mpg)) + 
    geom_histogram() +
    ggtitle("Histogram of miles per gallon")
```

Not ideal: too many bins, which defeats the purpose of a histogram.
We can manually specify the bins using the `breaks` option.

```{r}
ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = mpg)) + 
    geom_histogram(breaks = seq(10, 35, 5)) +
    ggtitle("Histogram of miles per gallon")
```


# Scatterplots: continuous variable vs. continuous variable

*What is the relationship between `mpg` and `weight`?*

```{r}
ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(y = mpg, x = weight)) + 
    geom_point(size = 2) + 
    ggtitle("Miles per gallon vs. weight")
```

# Lineplots: continuous variable vs. time variable

*What is the relationship between `mpg` and time?*

We will plot the yearly mean mpg against the year.
To create the corresponding table, we use the following code, which we will explain in later lectures.
```{r}
library(fueleconomy)
data(vehicles)
mpg <- vehicles %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(`mean highway mpg` = mean(hwy))

head(mpg)
```

Now, we make our usual scatterplot
```{r}

ggplot(data = mpg, aes(y = `mean highway mpg`, x = year)) +
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Mean highway mpg by year")
```

**Hmmm, not so good...**

Let's replace `geom_point` with `geom_line`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(y = `mean highway mpg`, x = year)) +
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle("Mean highway mpg by year")
```

# Boxplots & violin plots: continuous variable vs. categorical variable

*For each value of cylinder, what is the distribution of `mpg` like?*

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = cylinders, y = mpg)) +
    ggtitle("Distribution of mpg by cylinders")
```

We can store parts of a plot as a variable and re-use it with different layers:

<div class="column-left-padded">
```{r}
p + geom_boxplot()
```
</div>
<div class="column-right-padded">
```{r}
p + geom_violin()
```
</div>

# Position: Arranging bar plots
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = cylinders, fill = engine)) +
    ggtitle("Count by cylinders") +
    xlab("No. of cylinders")
```
In a bar plot, we have different ways of arranging the bars:

<div class="column-left-padded">
```{r}
p + geom_bar(position = "stack") # default setting
```
</div>
<div class="column-right-padded">

```{r}
p + geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```
</div>

# Position: Seeing obscured data

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = cylinders, y = mpg)) +
    ggtitle("mpg by cylinders")
```

Often, points will obscure one another and we need to move them out of the way to see what's going on.
<div class="column-left-padded">
```{r}
p + geom_point()
```
</div>
<div class="column-right-padded">

```{r}
p + geom_point(position = "jitter")
```
</div>

# Common graphical specifcations

## Aesthetics

These aesthetics are shared by many different geoms and so are good to know off the top of you head

* `x`, `y`: coordinates
* `color`: (out)line color, `fill`: fill color
* `size`: point size or (out)line width,  `shape`: shape of points (circle, x, square etc...)
* `linetype`: solid, dashed, dottet, etc. line specification
* `alpha`: transparency
* `group`: which points to link together with lines

Some geoms have special aesthetics - these are usually documented in the help file for the corresponding geom.

## Geoms

We've gone over many of these in the previous slides, but they're assembled in this list for reference

* `geom_point()`: Points on a scatter plot. Requires `x` and `y` aesthetics.
* `geom_line()`: Points connected by a line in order of increasing x coordinated. Requires `x` and `y` aesthetics. `geom_path()` is similar, but connects the points in the order that they appear in the data frame, which is useful for drawing lines that are not of functions of the x-axis.
* `geom_histogram()`: Histogram of values in column specified by `x`. `geom_freqpoly()` is a similar geom that is essentially just the outline of a histogram and is useful when you want to overlay several histograms.
* `geom_bar()`: Bar chart indicating the number of observations in each of the categories specified by `x`. If you supply a `y` aesthetic and pass the argument `stat = "identity"`, the `y` aesthetic will specify the height of each bar.
* `geom_polygon()`: Shape with vertices specified by x-y coordinates. Make sure to include a `group` aesthetic to specify which polygon each observation is part of. This is useful for drawing maps.

* **By hexadecimal value:** e.g "#0000FF", "#FF0000", "#000000", "#FFFFFF"

# Combining multiple plots into one graphic: layers

<img style="vertical-align:middle" src="img/Plot 2 Layers.png"> **=** <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="img/Plot Layer 1.png"> **+** <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="img/Plot Layer 2.png">

Each layer contains (essentially):

* 1 dataset
* 1 **geom**etric object
* 1 specification of **aes**thetic mappings

```{r}
ggplot() +
    geom_boxplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = cylinders, y = mpg)) +
    geom_point(data = efficiency, aes(x = cylinders, y = mpg), position = "jitter")
```

Often, theses are shared between layers, and can be inherited from the `ggplot()` function call to save time and minimize errors:

```{r}
ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = cylinders, y = mpg)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    geom_point(position = "jitter")
```

The convention is to always pass arguments that are common to all elements of the graphic to `ggplot()` arguments that are specific to certain plots to their corresponding `geom_` function.

This is efficient, and makes your intentions clearer for anyone reading your code (remember, in 99% of cases, this will be you!)

# A more complicated multi-layer example

```{r}
vehicles
mpg
```

Let's make a plot of mpg vs year.
We'll include a series of boxplots from the `vehicles` table, and overlay a line showing the yearly average.

```{r}
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year)) +
    geom_boxplot(
        data = vehicles,
        aes(group = factor(year), y = hwy)) +
    geom_line(
        data = mpg,
        aes(y = `mean highway mpg`),
        color = "red", size = 2) +
    labs(
        title = "Change in highway mpg over time",
        y = "Highway mpg"
    )
```

Things to note in this plot:

* `geom_boxplot` and `geom_line` both inherit the aesthetic `x = year` from `ggplot`, but other aesthetics are provided by the layers.
* `geom_boxplot` has the `group` aesthetic, which makes sure that the boxplots are grouped by year even though the x-axis is a continuous variable.
* The `color = "red", size = 2` arguments of `geom_line` are passed outside the `aes()` specification. This means that these specifications will be applied to all data in that plot, and `ggplot` will not produce a legend for this aesthetic.
* The function `labs` allows us to label aesthetics. In our case, we've labelled the `y` aesthetic and kept the `x` aesthetic as the default value.
* The first argument of `ggplot` is usually a data table. Since we are not specifying one, we need to use `ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year))` instead of `ggplot(aes(x = year))` to make this explicit to R.

# Combining multiple plots into one graphic: facets

Instead of seeing plots overlaid on top of each other, we might want to see them side-by-side.

The `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()` functions allow us to split out data into several side-by-side plots according to some variable:
```{r}
ggplot(efficiency, aes(x = weight, y = mpg, color = factor(cylinders))) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(vars(factor(gears)))
```

* `facet_wrap` is for splitting along a single variable, and will arrange the plots in whatever grid it decides is most efficient.

* `facet_grid` allows us to choose two faceting variables, and split our data further

We can go crazy with these options, making our graphic display really a lot of information:
```{r}
ggplot(
    data = efficiency,
    mapping = aes(
        x = weight,
        y = mpg,
        fill = factor(cylinders),
        size = horsepower)) +
    geom_point(color = "black", alpha = 0.5, shape = 21) + # outlined circle
    facet_grid(
        cols = vars(transmission),
        rows = vars(engine),
        margins = TRUE, # include unfaceted scatter plots on the edges
        labeller = label_both) # include the name of the faceting variables
```

It's easy to go overboard with this, though, so be careful not to overdo it - the above graphic is fun and useful for general data exploration, but is getting so busy that it no longer makes a single coherent point.

# Graphical customization

Until now, we've only been specifying the *logic* of our plots and letting R do the actual laying out.

This is a good thing: the people that designed `ggplot` are graphic designers and data visualization experts.
You (probably) are not.

However, if you do want something specific, R `ggplot` has extensive customization options available.

## Themes

These determine the look of everything that *isn't data*.
That is, the axes, labels, gridlines, background, ...

A full list of themes can be found on this page: <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html>

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = efficiency, aes(x = weight, y = mpg, color = cylinders)) +
    ggtitle("mpg by weight") +
    geom_point()
```

<div class="main">
<div class="column-left-padded">
```{r}
p + theme_gray() # default
```

```{r}
p + theme_bw()
```
</div>

<div class="column-right-padded">
```{r}
p + theme_classic()
```

```{r}
p + theme_dark()
```
</div>
</div>

## Axis scales

Done using the `scale_(x/y)_continuous` functions.
Many examples given here: <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html>

<div class="main">
<div class="column-left-padded">
Set the x- and y-axis limits
```{r}
p +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 6000)) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 40))
```

Specify where you want axis ticks
```{r}
p +
    scale_x_continuous(
        breaks = c(2000, 3650, 4000)) +
    scale_y_continuous(
        minor_breaks = c(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15))
```
</div>

<div class="column-right-padded">
Apply transformations to the axes
```{r}
p +
    scale_x_continuous(trans = "reverse") + 
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10")
```

Specify where you want the axes to appear
```{r}
p +
    scale_x_continuous(position = "top") + 
    scale_y_continuous(position = "right")
```
</div>
</div>

## Other customizations

Generally, each aesthetic has a corresponding `scale_` function for customization.
I've provided links to several of them here, as they work similarly to the functions that we've seen already:

* Colors: <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html>
* Linetypes: <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html>
* Shapes: <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_shape.html>

You can easily find more with some light googling.
