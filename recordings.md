@def title = "Lecture recordings"

Enrolled students can also find the lecture recordings on the Canvas Zoom tab.

Due to slow upload speeds, the recordings should appear on this page the evening of the corresponding lecture.

# 2021 Recordings

These recordings do not contain the breakout-room sections of each session.
The 2020 recordings contain strictly more complete and in-depth presentations of each week's topic.
