# Announcements
* Stanford has already announced many major changes to instruction, and this uncertainty is likely to continue. Please regularly monitor the [course changes](/distance/) page for up-to-date information about this course.
* No lectures week 1 (April 7, April 9)
* Make sure to [install R](/install-R/) _before_ coming to class. If you are having trouble, I will be holding office hours on TBA.

# Course description

This short course runs for weeks two through five of the quarter.
It is recommended for undergraduate students who want to use R in the humanities or social sciences and for students who want to learn the basics of R programming.
The goal of the short course is to familiarize students with R's tools for data analysis.
Lectures will be interactive with a focus on learning by example, and assignments will be application-driven.
No prior programming experience is needed.
Topics covered include basic data structures, File I/O, data transformation and visualization, simple statistical tests, etc, and some useful packages in R.

Prerequisite: undergraduate student.
Priority given to non-engineering students.
Laptops necessary for use in class.

# Assignments

## Final project & proposal (graded)
The only graded assignments for this class are the final project (80%) and the project proposal (20%).
Click here for more details on these assignments.

## Programming questions (not graded)
Programming is one of those things that you can't learn just by listening to lectures: you have to practice (and practice and practice)!
However, since this is a 1 credit class, I don't want to have graded assignments on top of the project.
To that end, after each session I will release a few questions to test your understanding of that session's material, and will release the answers a few days later.
Responses to these questions will _NOT_ be graded.

# Course materials

There is no textbook for this class. Having said that, much of the material for this class was heavily inspired by "R for Data Science" by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham which is available online for free [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). It is very comprehensive and well-written, and I recommend it highly to anyone who wants to do data science in R!
